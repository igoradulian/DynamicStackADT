Dynamic Stack ADT

Problem
This ADT created for implementing Stack based on dynamic arrays and
can be used for various taks.

Methods implemented:
* push - adds items to the stack
* pop - remove item at the top of the stack
* peek - gets item from top of the stack
* count - count items in the stack
* clear - remove all items from stack
* isEmpty - checks if stack is empty

How to use:
Just clone project or download the zip file. If you don't want use them as part of CMAKE
just copy these files:

StackInterface.h\n
DynamicStack.h\n
DynamicStack.cpp\n

I also would appricated if you suggest improvements and fix bugs.
